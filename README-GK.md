# Stable Baselines (guyk1971)

First review the official [README file](README.md)

To have it run from source on the local server, dont install it using pip install.  
After installing the prerequisites, do the following:  
copy the code to <stable-baselines_path> and then add it to python path:  
`export PYTHONPATH=<stable-baselines_path>:$PYTHONPATH`

it is recommended to add this line to .bashrc
once done, you should be able to run it from command line.

I have copied the colab notebooks to a folder called `my_colabs`
