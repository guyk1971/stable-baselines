train_gymcc --> train_on_env
train_batch_rl --> train_on_batch

refactor base class to include models for batch mode:
                    BaseRLModel
                        |
             -------------------------
             |                       |
        OffPolicyRLModel        OffPolicyBatchRLModel

The OffPolicyBatchRLModel will get experience buffer in its learn method and if env is not provided, will get
observation_space and action_space in its constructor
